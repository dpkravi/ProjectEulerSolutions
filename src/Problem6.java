/*
The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
        12 + 22 + ... + 102 = 385

        The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
        (1 + 2 + ... + 10)2 = 552 = 3025

        Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.

        Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
